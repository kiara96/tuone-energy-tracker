AJP\u2019s report shows that we can leverage South Carolina\u2019s industry strengths to provide support for these projects and nurture local projects that would grow the economy while meeting our energy needs.\u201dThe report also provides recommendations to take advantage of the opportunities from offshore wind.They include: expanding the Angel Tax Credit and the SC Launch program to bolster access to capital for South Carolina\u2019s early-stage startups; and leveraging integrated basic education and skills programs at technical colleges to address skills gap and boost manufacturing employment.The state's ports should also be assessed for readiness to perform a role in the sector."}

Currently, the FiT rate is at $0.085\/kWh for onshore projects and $0.098\/kWh for offshore projects.Massman found this extension to be essential, as projects waiting to be included in the plan are unlikely to begin commercial operation before November 2021 due to the long time needed to prepare and construct these projects.In particular, investors are required to carry out wind measurement for at least 12 months for feasibility study reports. Wind turbines are also mostly imported from abroad, which costs investors extra time, especially when there is an unexpected delay of equipment delivery.Further, wind power projects included in the electricity development planning in the Southwestern provinces are mostly offshore or near-the-shore projects using technology and techniques different from those implemented for onshore turbines, hence requiring longer project preparation time.\u201cNot to mention, the regulations on determining sea borders, licensing for usage of the sea area are quite complicated, thus further increasing project schedule time and costs associated with offshore projects,\u201d Massman added.The document also requests MOIT to prepare the formulation of the National Electricity Development Planning in the 2021-2030 period, with a vision to 2045 to submit to the Prime Minister for approval before 31 October."}
