Currently, the FiT rate is at $0.085\/kWh for onshore projects and $0.098\/kWh for offshore projects.Massman found this extension to be essential, as projects waiting to be included in the plan are unlikely to begin commercial operation before November 2021 due to the long time needed to prepare and construct these projects.In particular, investors are required to carry out wind measurement for at least 12 months for feasibility study reports. Wind turbines are also mostly imported from abroad, which costs investors extra time, especially when there is an unexpected delay of equipment delivery.Further, wind power projects included in the electricity development planning in the Southwestern provinces are mostly offshore or near-the-shore projects using technology and techniques different from those implemented for onshore turbines, hence requiring longer project preparation time.\u201cNot to mention, the regulations on determining sea borders, licensing for usage of the sea area are quite complicated, thus further increasing project schedule time and costs associated with offshore projects,\u201d Massman added.The document also requests MOIT to prepare the formulation of the National Electricity Development Planning in the 2021-2030 period, with a vision to 2045 to submit to the Prime Minister for approval before 31 October."}

However, since we have high-quality graphene in our material, we have managed to achieve high durability in both tests and under long testing periods, which is important for the future commercialisation of these materials.
