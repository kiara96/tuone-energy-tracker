The hydrogen is converted by hydrogenation reaction using toluene into methylcyclohexane (MCH), which is a liquid at ambient temperature and pressure, meaning existing facilities can be used for storage and transport.The MCH is shipped to Tokyo Bay, where the hydrogen is extracted at the new dehydrogenation plant at the Keihin refinery, operated by Toa Oil, a subsidiary of Idemitsu Kosan. The project supplies the separated hydrogen from the dehydrogenation plant and blends it with byproduct gas to fuel gas turbines at the 80-MW Mizue Power Station inside the Keihin refinery.
